You can finalize a migration and transfer your application
workload from the source to the destination cluster using the
``mongosync`` cutover process. 

.. note::

   Before you switch your application workload to the
   destination cluster, you should always verify that the sync
   was successful. For more information, see
   :ref:`c2c-verification`.

Steps
-----

.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal 

   .. step:: Verify the status of the :program:`mongosync` process. 
    
      Call the :ref:`progress <c2c-api-progress>` endpoint to determine
      the status of ``mongosync`` before starting the cutover process. 
      Ensure that the ``mongosync`` process  status indicates the 
      following values:  

      - ``canCommit`` is ``true``. 

      - ``lagTimeSeconds`` is small (near ``0``). 
   
        If ``lagTimeSeconds`` isn't close to ``0`` when the cutover
        starts, cutover might take a long time. 
  
      The following example returns the status of the synchronization process.

         :language: json
         :copyable: false
         :emphasize-lines: 5, 8


   .. step:: Stop any write operations to the synced collections on the source. 

      - If you started ``mongosync`` with ``enableUserWriteBlocking``
        set to ``true``, ``mongosync`` blocks all write operations on
        the entire source cluster during the commit (step 4) for you. 
      - If you didn't start ``mongosync`` with
        ``enableUserWriteBlocking``, ensure that writes are disabled.
        For example, run the :dbcommand:`setUserWriteBlockMode` command on the
        source cluster:

        .. code-block:: javascript

           db.adminCommand( {
              setUserWriteBlockMode: 1,
              global: true 
           } )

      - If ``mongosync`` uses filtered sync, it's not necessary to
        disable writes to the entire source cluster. But you must ensure
        that write operations are stopped for the collections included
        by the filter. 

   .. step:: Send a :ref:`commit <c2c-api-commit>` request to ``mongosync``.

      If you started multiple ``mongosync`` instances for your
      migration, you must issue a commit request for each ``mongosync``
      instance.

         :language: json
         :copyable: false

      .. note:: 

         After you submit a ``commit`` request, call the ``progress`` endpoint
         to ensure that the ``mongosync`` state is ``COMMITTING`` or 
         ``COMMITTED``.

   .. step:: Wait until you can perform writes on the destination cluster.

      Call the ``progress`` endpoint to determine if ``canWrite`` is
      ``true``. If ``canWrite`` is ``false``, wait until ``progress``
      shows ``canWrite`` is ``true``.

                     }
               },
            "success": true
         }


   .. step:: Verify data transfer.

      Verify the successful sync of data from the source to the
      destination cluster.

      For more information, see :ref:`c2c-verification`.

   .. step:: Enable application writes on the destination cluster.

      To enable writes, update :dbcommand:`setUserWriteBlockMode`:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.adminCommand(
           {
             setUserWriteBlockMode: 1,
             global: false
           }
         )

   .. step:: Call the ``progress`` endpoint to determine the status of the ``mongosync`` process.

      When the ``mongosync`` progress response indicates that the 
      ``mongosync`` state is ``COMMITTED``, the cutover process is
      complete.
