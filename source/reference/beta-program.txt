Each ``mongosync`` release has a corresponding {+c2c-beta-program-short+} 
build that includes its own set of experimental features.

.. _c2c-beta-program-disclaimer:

Get Started 
-----------

To request access to the {+c2c-beta-program-short+} binaries, please file a 
`HELP ticket <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/HELP>`_.

When you first run the {+c2c-beta-program-short+} binary, you must accept the 
following disclaimer:

.. code-block:: shell
   :copyable: false
  
   MongoDB restricts access to beta features via the beta build. Your use 
   of the beta is governed by the language specified in the Cloud 
   Subscription Agreement, Cloud Terms of Service, or other applicable 
   agreement between you and MongoDB with respect to your use of 
   mongosync.
   
   You understand that features are available through the beta build, and 
   flags are not generally available. All use of beta builds is at your own 
   risk. Beta builds provide no stability guarantees; API, UI, options, and 
   behaviors may change or be removed any time. MongoDB will never issue a 
   Critical Advisory or notify about defects in beta builds. 
   
   You should follow feature usage guidance provided by Field and R&D 
   without deviation and should only use beta builds for one-time, human-
   supervised migrations (e.g., not for continuous sync or automated 
   migrations). Beta capabilities are not intended for use to migrate 
   production workloads.
