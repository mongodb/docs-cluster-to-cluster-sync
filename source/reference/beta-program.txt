Terms of Use 
------------

MongoDB restricts access to beta features via the beta build. 

Features available through the beta build and flags are not generally available. 
All use of beta builds is at your own risk, even with MongoDB's help, guidance, 
and support. Beta builds provide no stability guarantees; API, UI, options, and 
behaviors may change or be removed at any time. Beta builds may contain bugs, 
both major and minor, including bugs that result in data inconsistency. MongoDB 
will never issue a Critical Advisory or any other form of notification about 
defects in beta builds

MongoDB may pursue any of the following options for future development of beta 
features:

- Productionize a beta feature as generally available 
- Continue offering the feature in the beta 
- Remove or change a beta feature at any time

You agree to abide by all of the following requirements and restrictions on the 
use of beta builds:

- You agree to follow feature usage guidance provided by Field and R&D without 
  deviation
- You agree to use beta builds for one-time, human-supervised migrations only 
  (e.g., not for continuous sync or automated migrations)
- You agree to use beta capabilities to migrate production workloads only in 
  situations where data loss is acceptable.
- You agree to provide usage and product feedback on beta features through 
  recurring calls to MongoDB professional services and product management.
