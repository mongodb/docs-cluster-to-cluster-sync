Limitations
===========

.. include:: /includes/preview-warning

{+c2c-full-product-name+} is under active development. This preview
release has several limitations. Review the list for changes after the
{+c2c-product-name+} General Availability release.

.. warning::

   ``mongosync`` does not check for compliance with the documented
   limitations. Please ensure that your application is not affected by
   the limitations . Running ``mongosync`` in the presence of one of
   these limitations could lead to undefined behavior on the destination
   cluster.

General Limitations
-------------------

- The minimum supported server version is MongoDB 6.0.
- The source and destination clusters must have the same release
  version.
- The minimum supported :dbcommand:`Feature Compatibility Version
  <setFeatureCompatibilityVersion>` is 6.0.
- The source and destination clusters must have the same Feature
  Compatibility Version.
- The destination cluster must be empty.
- DDL operations are currently not supported during syncing. 
- ``mongosync`` does not validate that the clusters or the environment
  are properly configured. 
- The primary shard cannot be :dbcommand:`reassigned <movePrimary>`
  while syncing.
- Other clients must not write to the destination cluster while
  ``mongosync`` is running.
- If write blocking is disabled, the client must :ref:`prevent writes
  <c2c-api-start>` to the source cluster before starting the commit
  process.
- Synchronizing a subset of the source data, "Filtered
  Synchronization", is not supported.
- Network compression is not supported.
- :dbcommand:`applyOps` operations from the source cluster are not
  supported.
- Serverless clusters are not supported.
- The MongoDB Shared Tier is not supported.
- The :data:`system.js <<database>.system.js>` collection is not
  replicated.
- Documents that have dollar (``$``) prefixed field names are not
  supported. See :ref:`Field Names with Periods and Dollar Signs
  <crud-concepts-dot-dollar-considerations>`.

MongoDB Community Edition
-------------------------

{+c2c-product-name+} supports a limited number of operations with
MongoDB Community Edition. Please contact a sales representative to
discuss your requirements.

Unsupported Collection Types
----------------------------

- Collections with collation are currently not supported.
- Capped collections are currently not supported.
- Time-series collections are not supported.


Sharded Clusters
----------------

- The :ref:`shard topologies <sharding-introduction>` must be the same
  in the source and target clusters. The following configurations are
  not supported.

  - Replica set to sharded cluster.
  - Sharded cluster to replica set.
  - Unequal numbers of source and destination shards.

- There is no replication for zone configuration. ``mongosync``
  replicates data, it does not inherit zones.
- Shards cannot be added or removed while synchronizing.
- Only indexes which exist on all shards are synchronized.
- The shard key cannot be :ref:`refined <shard-key-refine>` while
  synchronizing.
- The shard key cannot be modified using :dbcommand:`reshardCollection`
  during resharding.


Reversing
---------

If the old source has :ref:`unique indexes <index-type-unique>` which
are partially distributed across shards, reversing may cause failures.
Ensure that unique indexes exist on all shards before reversing.


Multiple Clusters
-----------------

- Syncing multiple source clusters to one destination cluster is not
  supported.
- Syncing one source cluster to many destination clusters is not
  supported.
