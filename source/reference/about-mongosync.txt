About ``mongosync``
========================

The ``mongosync`` binary is the primary process used in {+c2c-product-name+}. 
``mongosync`` migrates data from one cluster to another and keeps the 
clusters in continuous sync. You can use ``mongosync`` to create dedicated 
analytics, development, or testing clusters that mirror your production 
environment. 

``mongosync`` enters different states depending on the requests it receives. 
The current ``mongosync`` state determines which API operations you can run. 
For more information on ``mongosync`` states, see 
:ref:`mongosync States <c2c-states>`.

.. note:: 

   Most state transitions happen as the result of an API call. The exceptions 
   are:

   - The transition from ``COMMITTING`` to ``COMMITTED``
   - The transition from ``REVERSING`` to ``RUNNING``

How ``mongosync`` Works
------------------------

Initial Connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``mongosync`` must create an initial connection to the source and destination 
clusters before it can start to sync data. For more information, see 
:ref:`c2c-connecting`.

When ``mongosync`` connects to the source and destination clusters, it is in the 
:ref:`IDLE <c2c-state-idle>` state.  

During Sync 
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`start <c2c-api-start>` endpoint begins the 
:ref:`RUNNING <c2c-state-running>` state. 

If you start a new sync, ``mongosync`` syncs data to the destination cluster. 
If you make subsequent writes to the source cluster, ``mongosync`` applies them 
to the destination cluster.  

For every collection on the source, ``mongosync`` creates a corresponding 
collection on the destination. 

``mongosync`` temporarily alters some collection characteristics during 
the ``RUNNING`` state and changes these back to their source 
cluster characteristics during the ``COMMIT`` state. For more information, see
:ref:`Commit Alters <c2c-commit-alters>`.

Collection Copy
'''''''''''''''

Collection copy is the initial full data transfer that copies each collection 
from the source cluster to the destination cluster. ``mongosync`` performs 
collection copy by splitting each source collection into partitions, gathering 
all partitions from all collections into one list, and copying all partitions 
to their corresponding destination collections.

Change Event Application
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

Change event application (CEA) is an ongoing process that continuously updates 
the destination cluster when there are changes to the source cluster. If there 
are multiple ``mongosync`` instances, all the ``mongosync`` instances finish 
collection copy before entering CEA.

During CEA, ``mongosync`` receives :ref:`change stream <changeStreams>` events 
from the source cluster, converts these events into writes, and applies these 
writes on the destination cluster. CEA ensures both :ref:`CRUD <crud>` and 
:ref:`DDL <c2c-mongosync-ddl>` operations are handled accurately.

Pausing Sync
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`pause <c2c-api-pause>` endpoint begins the 
:ref:`PAUSED <c2c-state-paused>` state. To use the ``pause`` endpoint, 
``mongosync`` must be in the ``RUNNING`` state.

During the ``PAUSED`` state, the sync process is paused.

The :ref:`resume <c2c-api-resume>` endpoint resumes a paused synchronization 
session and returns ``mongosync`` to the ``RUNNING`` state. To use the 
``resume`` endpoint, ``mongosync`` must be in the ``PAUSED`` state.

Committing Sync
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`commit <c2c-api-commit>` endpoint begins the 
:ref:`COMMITTING <c2c-state-committing>`state. To use the ``commit`` endpoint, 
``mongosync`` must be in the ``RUNNING`` state. 

During the ``COMMITTING`` state, ``mongosync`` finalizes the sync between the 
source cluster and the destination cluster by stopping continuous sync 
between them and restoring collection characteristics that ``mongosync`` 
temporarily alters during synchronization. 

Once you call the ``commit`` endpoint, ``mongosync`` halts any writes on the 
source cluster and retrieves the timestamp of the most recent operation in the 
source cluster. 

If there are no errors, you see a success message and ``mongosync`` exits CEA by 
processing events up until the commit timestamp. Then, ``mongosync`` corrects 
indexes and resolves document conflicts. If write blocking is enabled, 
``mongosync`` turns write operations back on. 

``mongosync`` updates its state to ``COMMITTED`` once the ``COMMITTING`` state 
is over. The ``COMMITTED`` state indicates the 
:ref:`cutover process <c2c-cutover-process>` is finished, and you can direct 
writes to the destination cluster.

Reversing Sync
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`reverse <c2c-api-reverse>` endpoint starts the 
:ref:`REVERSING <c2c-state-reversing>` state. To use the ``reverse`` endpoint, 
``mongosync`` must be in the ``COMMITTED`` state. 

During the ``REVERSING`` state, ``mongosync`` copies data from the 
destination cluster to the source cluster. Then, ``mongosync`` swaps the source 
and destination clusters and resumes applying change events.

If ``REVERSING`` is successful, ``mongosync`` enters the ``RUNNING`` state. The 
synchronization continues in the reverse direction from the original sync job.
