The ``mongosync`` binary is the primary process used in {+c2c-product-name+}. 
``mongosync`` migrates data from a source cluster to a destination cluster and 
keeps the clusters in continuous sync. You can use ``mongosync`` to create 
dedicated analytics, development, or testing clusters that mirror your 
production environment. 

``mongosync`` keeps track of its current actions through 
:ref:`states <c2c-states>`. ``mongosync`` enters different states depending on 
the requests it receives. The current ``mongosync`` state determines which API 
operations you can run. 

.. note:: 

   Most state transitions happen as the result of an API call. The exceptions 
   are:

   - The transition from ``COMMITTING`` to ``COMMITTED``
   - The transition from ``REVERSING`` to ``RUNNING``

To view the current state of ``mongosync``, use the :ref:`/progress
<c2c-api-progress>` endpoint.

How ``mongosync`` Works
-----------------------

Connect Source and Destination Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You must create an initial connection to the source and destination 
clusters before ``mongosync`` can start to sync data. For more information, see 
:ref:`c2c-connecting`.

When ``mongosync`` connects to the source and destination clusters, the 
synchronization process enters the :ref:`IDLE <c2c-state-idle>` state.  

During Sync 
~~~~~~~~~~~

To start the synchronization process, call the :ref:`start <c2c-api-start>` 
endpoint. 

The ``start`` endpoint begins the ``RUNNING`` state, which is when ``mongosync`` 
syncs data from the source cluster to the destination cluster. Then, if you 
make subsequent writes to the source cluster, ``mongosync`` applies the 
operations to the destination cluster. 

For every source collection that is to be synced, ``mongosync`` creates a 
corresponding collection on the destination. 

``mongosync`` temporarily alters some collection characteristics during 
the ``RUNNING`` state and changes these back to their source 
cluster characteristics during the ``COMMIT`` state. For more information, see
:ref:`Commit Alters <c2c-commit-alters>`.

The ``RUNNING`` state includes two phases:

- :ref:`Collection copy <c2c-collection-copy>`

- :ref:`Change event application <c2c-cea>`

.. _c2c-collection-copy:

Collection Copy
'''''''''''''''

During the collection copy phase, ``mongosync`` executes the initial data 
transfer from the source cluster to the destination 
cluster. ``mongosync`` performs this data transfer by splitting the 
source collections into partitions and copying the partitions to their 
corresponding destination collections.

.. _c2c-cea:

Change Event Application
''''''''''''''''''''''''

During the change event application (CEA) phase, ``mongosync`` continuously 
updates the destination cluster when you make changes to the source cluster. 

``mongosync`` finishes the collection copy phase before starting the CEA phase.

During the CEA phase, ``mongosync`` receives 
:ref:`change stream <changeStreams>` events from the source cluster, converts 
these events into writes, and applies these writes on the destination cluster. 
When the CEA phase begins, ``mongosync`` first applies the change stream events 
that are recieved during the collection copy phase before moving on to the 
events that are recieved during the CEA phase. 

Pausing Sync
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To pause the sync process and enter the :ref:`PAUSED <c2c-state-paused>` state,
call the :ref:`pause <c2c-api-pause>` endpoint. 

To resume a paused sync process and return ``mongosync`` to the 
``RUNNING`` state, call the :ref:`resume <c2c-api-resume>` endpoint. 

Finalizing Sync
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To finalize the sync between the source and destination clusters, 
call the :ref:`commit <c2c-api-commit>` endpoint. 

The ``commit`` endpoint starts the :ref:`COMMITTING <c2c-state-committing>` 
state, which is when ``mongosync`` stops continuous sync between the source and 
destination clusters. 

When the ``COMMITTING`` state begins, ``mongosync`` halts any writes on the 
source cluster and retrieves the timestamp of the most recent operation on the 
source cluster. 

If there are no errors, ``mongosync`` sends a success message and exits CEA by 
processing events up until the commit timestamp. It also restores collection 
characteristics that ``mongosync`` temporarily alters during synchronization 
and turns write operations back on. 

When the above process is completed, ``mongosync`` enters the 
:ref:`COMMITTED <c2c-state-committed>` state. The ``COMMITTED`` state indicates 
that the :ref:`cutover process <c2c-cutover-process>` is finished.

Reversing Sync
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To reverse the direction of a committed sync operation, call the 
:ref:`reverse <c2c-api-reverse>` endpoint. 

The reverse endpoint starts the :ref:`REVERSING <c2c-state-reversing>` state.
``mongosync`` copies data from the destination cluster to the source cluster. 
Then, ``mongosync`` swaps the source and destination clusters and resumes 
applying change events.

If the reverse sync is successful, ``mongosync`` enters the ``RUNNING`` state. 
The synchronization continues in the reverse direction from the original 
sync job.
