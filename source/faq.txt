.. _c2c-faq-change-load:

Can I change my ``mongosync`` load level while ``mongosync`` is syncing? 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

You can adjust the load level during a ``mongosync`` migration by 
performing the following steps:

1. (Optional) Pause the ``mongosync`` processes.
   
   To pause ``mongosync``, run :ref:`c2c-api-pause` on each running
   ``mongosync`` process.
      
   You can resume the ``mongosync`` processes later from the paused
   state, as shown in the final step.
      
   .. tip::

      If you don't want to immediately resume data synchronization
      operations after live upgrade, consider pausing the
      ``mongosync`` processes. This is useful if you're coordinating
      operations from multiple ``mongosync`` processes.

#. Terminate the ``mongosync`` processes. 
   
   For directions on how to terminate a process, see your operating system documentation. 
#. Initialize the ``mongosync`` processes with the :option:`--loadLevel` option set to the new load level: 

   .. code-block:: javascript 

      ./bin/mongosync \
      mongosync \
            --cluster0 "<cluster0_connection_string>" \
            --cluster1 "<cluster1_connection_string>" \
            --loadLevel <newLevel> 

   For more detailed instructions, see the :ref:`Quickstart <c2c-quickstart>` guide.
#. Restart or Resume the ``mongosync`` processes. 

   If you paused any ``mongosync`` processes earlier in the optional
   first step, run :ref:`c2c-api-resume` on all ``mongosync`` processes.

   Call the :ref:`c2c-api-resume` endpoint on all paused ``mongosync`` processes.

   If you terminated any ``mongosync`` processes without using :ref:`c2c-api-pause`, 
   use the :ref:`c2c-api-start` endpoint to initiate data synchronization on these ``mongosync`` processes. 
   For more instructions, see :ref:`c2c-quickstart-synchronize`. 

   ``mongosync`` resumes the sync roughly where it was before you stopped the earlier proceses.
   Any partitions that were in progress at the time of termination will restart from the beginning. 

Can I perform reads or writes to my destination cluster while ``mongosync`` is syncing?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can perform reads at any time during synchronization. 
However, ``mongosync`` combines and reorders writes from the source to destination during synchronization, 
and also temporarily modifies various collection characteristics. 
As a result, the destination is not guaranteed to match the source at any point in time when the sync is running. 
For consistent reads, wait for the migration to :ref:`c2c-api-commit`. To learn more, see :ref:`mongosync-considerations`. 

Performing writes to your destination cluster during synchronization results in undefined behavior. 
To block writes on the destination cluster during sync, enable :ref:`write blocking <c2c-write-blocking>` when you :ref:`c2c-api-start` ``mongosync``.

Upon commit, it is only safe to write to the destination cluster when ``canWrite`` is ``true``. 
To check the value of ``canWrite``, run the :ref:`c2c-api-progress` endpoint.

To learn more about permissable reads and writes during synchronization, see :ref:`c2c-reads-and-writes`. 

.. note::
   
   Index builds on the destination cluster are treated as writes 
   while ``mongosync`` is syncing.

Can ``mongosync`` run on its own hardware? 
------------------------------------------

Yes, ``mongosync`` can run on its own hardware. ``mongosync`` does not
have to run on the servers that host your MongoDB instances. When
``mongosync`` runs on its own hardware, it can use an operating system
(OS) that is different than the OS on the source or destination
clusters.

What hardware specifications should the destination cluster have?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

For most migrations, the destination cluster should have higher hardware 
specifications than the source cluster, including the following properties:

- CPU
- Memory
- Disk I/O 

These hardware specifications ensure that the destination cluster can handle 
``mongosync`` writes and that the sync can keep up with the source cluster's 
workload.

.. _c2c-faq-increase-oplog:

Should I increase the size of the ``oplog`` in the source cluster?
------------------------------------------------------------------

.. include:: includes/fact-oplog-background.rst

Which connection string options does ``mongosync`` allow?
---------------------------------------------------------

``mongosync`` requires :ref:`readConcern: "majority" <read-concern>`
and :ref:`writeConcern: "majority" <write-concern>`. 

If the ``readConcern`` is not ``majority``, ``mongosync`` returns an
error:

.. code-block:: shell

   Invalid URI option, read concern must be majority

If the ``writeConcern`` is not ``majority``, ``mongosync`` returns an
error:

.. code-block:: shell

   Invalid URI option, write concern must be majority

``mongosync`` accepts all other :ref:`connection string options
<mongodb-uri>`.


Which security and authentication options are supported?
--------------------------------------------------------

``mongosync`` uses a standard MongoDB :ref:`connection string
<mongodb-uri>` to connect to the source and destination clusters. 

:ref:`LDAP <security-auth-ldap>` and :ref:`X509
<authentication-mechanism-x509>` are supported. For available
authentication options, see :ref:`authentication`.


Does ``mongosync`` automatically restart on error?
--------------------------------------------------

``mongosync`` does not automatically restart on error. However, you
can write a script or use your operating system's process managers,
``systemd`` for example, to restart the ``mongosync`` process. 

The ``mongosync`` binary is stateless. The metadata for restarting is
stored on the destination cluster.

A ``mongosync`` operation can be resumed if ``mongosync`` becomes
unavailable during synchronization. When ``mongosync`` becomes
available again, restart the ``mongosync`` process with the same
parameters. ``mongosync`` resumes the operation from where it stopped
when ``mongosync`` became unavailable.

.. _c2c-faq-arbiters:

Can the source or destination be a replica set with arbiters? 
-------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, the replica set can have arbiters. The source replica set must
have more than 2 non-arbiter nodes and you must sync from a non-arbiter
node. Use the source cluster's connection string to specify a
:ref:`read preference <mongodb-uri>` for a non-arbiter, data-bearing
node. 

What if I see a Slow Operation Warning?
---------------------------------------

Slow operation warnings can occur during the initial sync or the application 
of a change event when there is a slow read operation on the source cluster 
or a slow write operation on the destination cluster.  The warning may
indicate network congestion or resource strain on the source or destination
cluster.

While these warnings do not indicate failures in themselves, slow operations
can cause operation timeout errors in ``mongosync`` and migration failures.

If you see slow operation warnings, check CPU, memory, and network usage on the
source and destination clusters.  If the clusters are underprovisioned for your
needs, consider upgrading the cluster hardware.

Should I stop a migration if the logs contain the word "error" or "failure"?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

No, logs that contain the word "error" or "failure" show non-fatal
errors and do not signal that you need to stop ``mongosync`` early.
These logs do not indicate that ``mongosync`` is failing or corrupting
data. If a fatal error occurs, ``mongosync`` stops the sync and writes a
fatal log entry. 

What if I see a lot of duplicate key errors in the logs?
--------------------------------------------------------

Duplicate key errors are a normal part of the sync process. These errors can 
occur if:

- You insert a document on the source cluster after ``mongosync`` starts. 
  ``mongosync`` may directly copy the document and redundantly apply the insert 
  change event for the document later.
- You stop and resume ``mongosync``. This can lead to duplicate insertions when 
  ``mongosync`` restarts.
- ``mongosync`` encounters a transient error and reattempts an insertion that 
  may have already succeeded.

What should I do if mongosync returns a fatal error?
----------------------------------------------------

A fatal error indicates a problem that must be corrected and requires the 
migration to be restarted. After addressing the error, delete all migrated 
data on the destination cluster, including the ``mongosync_reserved_for_internal_use`` 
database. Then, relaunch ``mongosync`` and start a new migration.

Does ``mongosync`` Support TTL Indexes?
----------------------------------------

{+c2c-product-name+} supports syncing :ref:`index-feature-ttl` from the source
to the destination cluster.


Can I customize chunk distributions when syncing into a sharded cluster?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

No, you can't configure ``mongosync`` to customize chunk distributions
on a destination sharded cluster.  ``mongosync`` samples each collection
during initialization to determine how to distribute documents
efficiently across the destination clusterâ€™s shards after migration.
