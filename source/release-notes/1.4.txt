**Version 1.4 released June 16, 2023**

New Features
-------------

Set Cluster Workload Level
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in 1.4.0, you can set the workload level that
{+c2c-product-name+} uses to sync data between the source and
destination clusters. For more information, see the
:option:`--loadLevel` option.

Improved Resiliency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``mongosync`` 1.4.0 improves :term:`oplog` handling. The ``oplog``
handling improvement adds resiliency to migrations and reduces the time
to complete large migrations.

Faster Processing for Sharded Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Version 1.4.0 improves performance for replica sets and single-shard
clusters. Multi-shard clusters have even better speed improvements.

Telemetry
~~~~~~~~~

Starting in 1.4.0, ``mongosync`` collects anonymous, aggregated usage
data to improve MongoDB products. You can disable collection of this
:ref:`telemetry <c2c-telemetry>` data when you start ``mongosync``.

Bug Fixes
----------

- ``REP-2148`` Fixes an issue so documents with ``_id`` values that
  evaluate to the same string replicate correctly.

- ``REP-2411`` Fixes a collection naming issue. Prior to version 1.4.0,
  ``mongosync`` crashes when a new collection reuses a dropped
  collection's name with letter case changes.
  
  For example, previous versions of ``mongosync`` crash if a new
  ``SampleName`` collection replaces the dropped ``samplename``
  collection.
  
- ``REP-2378`` Fixes an issue caused by a server update,
  ``BACKPORT-15099``.

Additional Considerations
-------------------------

The MongoDB server's :dbcommand:`validate` command may report data
corruption on destination clusters that run MongoDB version 6.0 through
6.0.6. The data on the destination server is not corrupt. A bug in the
:ref:`WiredTiger <storage-wiredtiger>` database engine, ``WT-11051``,
causes the false report.

Minimum Supported Version
-------------------------

In 1.4.0, the minimum supported version of MongoDB is 6.0.5.
