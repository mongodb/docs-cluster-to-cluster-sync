Namespace Remapping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in 1.8 Beta, ``mongosync`` can migrate data from one database
on the source cluster into a new database on the destination. This allows you
to change database names during migration.

For more information, see :ref:`c2c-beta-namespace-remapping`.

Updates to ``mongosync`` ``/progress`` API endpoint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Returns a top-level boolean ``success`` field.

- Returns a new ``totalEventsApplied`` field.

- Reports per-partition progress tracking

See the :ref:`c2c-api-progress` documentation for more details.

Other Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~

Optimizations:

- Fixes and enhancements to significantly reduce the time needed to create 
  partitions and adds logging that tracks the partition creation process.

Other Changes:

- ``mongosync`` now performs a round robin assignment of the primary 
  shard for each database if the destination is a sharded cluster.

- ``mongosync`` now errors if it cannot create an index after 10 
  attempts. Previously, the system would attempt to create an index 
  indefinitely.

- ``mongosync`` now sends hostnames as telemetry.

- Improved performance of the initialization process by eliminating 
  the creation of unnecessary dummy indexes. ``mongosync`` now creates 
  dummy indexes for sharded collections only if the destination 
  cluster does not have an index to support the shard key.

Issues Fixed:

- Fixed a bug introduced in v1.0.0 that caused ``mongosync`` to fall 
  off the source cluster's oplog if no writes occurred on the source 
  cluster for an extended period of time.

- Fixed a bug introduced in v1.0.0 that caused ``mongosync`` to write 
  certain logs to a location outside of the specified log directory.

- Fixed a bug introduced in v1.0.0 that caused the ``mongosync`` 
  ``/progress`` endpoint to potentially return incorrect 
  ``totalBytes`` for sharded clusters.

Minimum Supported Version
-------------------------

In 1.8.0, the minimum supported versions of MongoDB are 6.0.16 and 7.0.9.
