Starting in version 1.2, ``mongosync`` can sync between clusters running 
older (pre-6.0) releases of MongoDB Server.  Use of this feature
requires additional preparation and configuration.

If you would like to migrate pre-6.0 versions of MongoDB Server
using ``mongosync``, please `contact <https://mongodb.com/contact>`__
your account team to inquire about Professional Services.
